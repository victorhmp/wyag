# Write Yourself a Git! (wyag)

This is a simple implementation of Git in Go. It's sole purpose is for me to explore how Git works in-depth, by implementing it from scratch, and also learn some more Go in the process.

Inspired by [Write yourself a Git!](https://wyag.thb.lt/), by Thibault Duplessis.
